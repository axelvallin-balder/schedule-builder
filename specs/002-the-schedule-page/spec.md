# Feature Specification: Calendar Schedule Display

**Feature Branch**: `002-the-schedule-page`  
**Created**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The schedule page should display a calendar. Here the schedule for a class will be shown. A searchable dropdown is used to choose which class schedule to show. The calendar only needs to display Monday-Friday. For now we can assume that the schedule is the same every week, so no need to switch between weeks. The lessons for every group in that class should be shown. If some groups have overlapping lessons, they should be displayed side by side. The user can switch between different schedules, and the default should be the latest active one."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úì Feature description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users viewing schedules
   ‚Üí Actions: View calendar, select class, select schedule, view lessons
   ‚Üí Data: Schedules, classes, groups, lessons
   ‚Üí Constraints: Monday-Friday only, same weekly pattern
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] tags below
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: Select class ‚Üí View calendar ‚Üí Switch schedules
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Calendar display, class selection, schedule switching, lesson visualization
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Schedule, Class, Group, Lesson, Calendar View
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Some clarifications needed for complete specification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: How should the calendar organize time slots? ‚Üí A: Custom configurable periods with varying durations
- Q: How should the system handle classes with no scheduled lessons? ‚Üí A: Show empty calendar grid with "No lessons scheduled" message
- Q: What is the acceptable calendar load time? ‚Üí A: Under 2 seconds
- Q: What time range should the calendar display cover each day? ‚Üí A: 8:00 - 16:00
- Q: How should overlapping lessons be displayed when there are many groups in a class? ‚Üí A: Scroll horizontally within time slots to show all lessons

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a school administrator or teacher, I want to view a weekly schedule for a specific class in a calendar format so that I can see when and where lessons are scheduled for each group within that class, enabling me to understand the class timetable at a glance and make informed scheduling decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the schedule page, **When** I open the class selection dropdown, **Then** I can search and select any available class
2. **Given** I have selected a class, **When** the calendar loads, **Then** I see a Monday-Friday grid showing all lessons for groups in that class
3. **Given** multiple groups have lessons at the same time, **When** viewing the calendar, **Then** the overlapping lessons are displayed side by side within the same time slot
4. **Given** multiple schedules exist, **When** I access the schedule page, **Then** the latest active schedule is displayed by default
5. **Given** I want to view a different schedule, **When** I select from the schedule dropdown, **Then** the calendar updates to show the selected schedule's lessons
6. **Given** I have selected a class with no lessons, **When** viewing the calendar, **Then** I see an empty calendar grid with appropriate messaging

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a class has no groups or lessons scheduled?
- How does the system handle classes with many groups (display overflow)?
- What occurs if no schedules are marked as active?
- How are lessons displayed if they span multiple time slots?
- What happens if lesson times conflict or overlap in complex ways?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a weekly calendar grid showing Monday through Friday only
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a searchable dropdown to select which class schedule to display
- **FR-003**: System MUST show all lessons for every group within the selected class on the calendar
- **FR-004**: System MUST display overlapping lessons side by side when multiple groups have lessons at the same time, with horizontal scrolling within time slots when many lessons exceed display width
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a dropdown to switch between different available schedules
- **FR-006**: System MUST default to displaying the latest active schedule when the page loads
- **FR-007**: System MUST update the calendar display when a different schedule is selected
- **FR-008**: System MUST show lesson details including subject and teacher
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle classes with no scheduled lessons by displaying an empty calendar grid with "No lessons scheduled" message
- **FR-010**: System MUST organize lessons by custom configurable time periods with varying durations (e.g., Period 1: 8:00-8:45, Period 2: 8:50-9:35)
- **FR-011**: System MUST display calendar time range from 8:00 to 16:00 for each day

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Calendar MUST load and display within 2 seconds
- **PR-002**: Schedule switching MUST update the display within 1 second

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Schedule**: Represents a complete timetable configuration with active/inactive status and creation date
- **Class**: Represents a school class containing multiple student groups, has a name and identifier
- **Group**: Represents a subset of students within a class, has lessons assigned to it
- **Lesson**: Represents a scheduled learning session with time slot, subject, location, and assigned groups
- **Calendar View**: Represents the weekly display grid showing Monday-Friday time slots with lesson placement
