## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What is the minimum allowed duration for a single lesson? → A: 45 minutes
- Q: What is the preferred maximum number of lessons per course per day? → A: 2 lessons per day maximum
- Q: How should the system handle unassigned teachers for courses during schedule generation? → A: Auto-assign available teachers during generation
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent user edits to the schedule? → A: Enable real-time collaborative editing
- Q: What should be the maximum number of alternative schedules the system can generate? → A: 5 alternatives maximum

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a school administrator, I want to generate and manage high school schedules based on predefined rules, so that I can create efficient schedules that respect teacher availability, group dependencies, and course requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have defined course requirements, teacher availability, and group dependencies
   **When** I generate a new schedule
   **Then** the system creates a valid schedule respecting all defined rules

2. **Given** I have a generated schedule
   **When** I view it in the weekly view
   **Then** I can see all lessons organized by class with proper breaks and lunch periods

3. **Given** I am not satisfied with a generated schedule
   **When** I request an alternative schedule
   **Then** the system generates a new valid schedule with different lesson arrangements

4. **Given** I want to modify rules
   **When** I access the rules management view
   **Then** I can view and edit all scheduling rules

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no valid schedule can be generated with the given rules?
- How does the system handle conflicts between group dependencies?
- What happens if a teacher's available hours are insufficient for their assigned lessons?
- How are partial lesson durations handled?
- How are concurrent edit conflicts resolved in real-time?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a rules management interface for defining scheduling constraints
- **FR-002**: System MUST support both manual and automatic teacher assignment:
  - Allow users to manually assign teachers to subjects they can teach
  - Automatically assign available qualified teachers to courses during schedule generation when not manually assigned
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to assign student groups to courses
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate schedules that respect all defined rules and constraints
- **FR-005**: System MUST enforce minimum 10-minute breaks between lessons for the same group
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure 30-minute lunch breaks for classes with lessons after 12:30
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent scheduling conflicts for teachers and groups
- **FR-008**: System MUST respect group dependencies in scheduling
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow manual modifications to generated schedules
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide alternative schedule generation
- **FR-011**: System MUST enforce teacher working hours (default 08:15-16:00)
- **FR-012**: System MUST split course hours into multiple lessons per week, with minimum lesson duration of 45 minutes
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow customization of break durations between specific subjects
- **FR-014**: System MUST limit courses to maximum 2 lessons per day
