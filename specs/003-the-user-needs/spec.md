# Feature Specification: Entity and Relationship Management for Schedule Rules

**Feature Branch**: `003-the-user-needs`  
**Created**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The user needs to be able to add groups, teachers, courses, subjects and classes. This should be managed via the rules management page. The user needs to be able to set up the necessary relations between these entities that will serve as the rules when generating the schedule."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: Feature involves entity management and relationship configuration
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: entities (groups, teachers, courses, subjects, classes), relationships, rules management
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] where applicable
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: Clear CRUD operations and relationship management workflows
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: All requirements are testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: Five main entities with relationships identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: No implementation details, focused on user needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: What level of availability constraints should the system support for teachers? ‚Üí A: Calendar-based with exceptions (e.g., weekly pattern plus vacation days, meetings)
- Q: What is the expected scale for bulk operations in this system? ‚Üí A: Medium scale (100-500 entities, school district)
- Q: When a user tries to delete an entity with existing relationships, what resolution options should the system provide? ‚Üí A: Offer cascade deletion (delete entity and all dependent relationships)
- Q: What file formats should the system support for entity import/export? ‚Üí A: Excel files (.xlsx) for business users
- Q: What types of data validation rules should the system enforce for entity integrity? ‚Üí A: Basic only (required fields, format validation)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a schedule administrator, I need to manage the fundamental entities (groups, teachers, courses, subjects, and classes) and define their relationships so that the schedule generation system has the necessary rules and constraints to create valid academic timetables.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the rules management page, **When** I create a new teacher with name and subject specializations, **Then** the teacher is available for assignment to courses and classes
2. **Given** I have created subjects and teachers, **When** I create a course linking a subject to a teacher, **Then** the course can be assigned to classes during schedule generation
3. **Given** I have existing groups and courses, **When** I create a class by combining groups with a course, **Then** the class becomes a schedulable unit with all necessary constraints
4. **Given** I have created multiple entities, **When** I modify a relationship (e.g., assign different teacher to course), **Then** all dependent classes reflect the change and schedule generation uses updated rules
5. **Given** I attempt to delete an entity, **When** it has existing relationships, **Then** the system shows dependent relationships and offers cascade deletion option with clear warning of what will be deleted

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I try to create duplicate entities (same name/identifier)?
- How does the system handle circular dependencies in entity relationships?
- What happens when I try to assign a teacher to a subject they're not qualified for?
- How does the system manage conflicts when the same teacher is assigned to multiple courses at overlapping times?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create, read, update, and delete Groups (student cohorts or organizational units)
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to create, read, update, and delete Teachers with their subject qualifications and calendar-based availability constraints (weekly patterns with exceptions)
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to create, read, update, and delete Subjects (academic disciplines or course topics)
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to create, read, update, and delete Courses by linking subjects to qualified teachers
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to create, read, update, and delete Classes by combining groups with courses
- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce relationship constraints (e.g., teachers can only teach subjects they're qualified for)
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent deletion of entities that have dependent relationships without explicit user confirmation, and MUST offer cascade deletion option (delete entity and all dependent relationships with warning)
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that all required entity relationships are established before allowing schedule generation
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear visual indication of entity relationships and dependencies
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow bulk operations for managing multiple entities efficiently (supporting up to 500 entities per operation for school district scale)
- **FR-011**: System MUST track and display entity usage statistics (e.g., how many classes use a particular teacher)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide search and filtering capabilities across all entity types
- **FR-016**: System MUST validate teacher availability against their calendar constraints before assigning classes
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain audit trail of entity changes for accountability (basic change logging with user, timestamp, and action type)
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate entity data integrity with basic validation rules (required fields, data format validation, field length limits)
- **FR-015**: System MUST support entity import/export functionality using Excel (.xlsx) format for business user accessibility

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Group**: Represents student cohorts or organizational units that need scheduled instruction, with attributes like name, size, and academic level
- **Teacher**: Represents instructors with qualifications, subject specializations, calendar-based availability constraints (weekly patterns with exceptions for vacation days, meetings, etc.), and teaching capacity limits
- **Subject**: Represents academic disciplines or course topics that can be taught, with metadata like credit hours and prerequisites
- **Course**: Represents the combination of a subject and qualified teacher, forming a teachable unit with specific duration and resource requirements
- **Class**: Represents the final schedulable unit combining one or more groups with a course, defining who learns what from whom

### Entity Relationships
- **Teacher ‚Üí Subject**: Many-to-many (teachers can teach multiple subjects, subjects can be taught by multiple teachers)
- **Course ‚Üí Teacher**: Many-to-one (courses have one primary teacher, teachers can teach multiple courses)
- **Course ‚Üí Subject**: Many-to-one (courses cover one subject, subjects can have multiple course offerings)
- **Class ‚Üí Group**: Many-to-many (classes can include multiple groups, groups can attend multiple classes)
