# Research: Entity and Relationship Management

## Problem Analysis

### Current State
- Existing data model in 001-schedule-builder defines core entities (Group, Teacher, Subject, Course, Class, Schedule, Lesson)
- Groups currently have one-to-one relationship with classes (`classId: string`)
- Basic schedule generation exists but lacks comprehensive entity management UI
- Rules management page exists but may not have full CRUD interfaces for all entities

### Gap Analysis
1. **Frontend Entity Management**: Missing comprehensive CRUD interfaces for Groups, Teachers, Subjects, Courses, Classes
2. **Data Model Update**: Groups need many-to-many relationship with Classes
3. **Relationship Management**: No UI for managing complex entity relationships
4. **Bulk Operations**: No bulk import/export or mass management capabilities
5. **Validation UI**: Limited frontend validation for entity relationships and constraints

## Technical Investigation

### Existing Data Model Review
From 001-schedule-builder/data-model.md:
- **Group**: Currently `classId: string` (needs update to support multiple classes)
- **Teacher**: Has `subjectIds: string[]` and working hours
- **Subject**: Basic entity with break duration
- **Course**: Links subject + teacher + groups
- **Class**: Basic entity with lunch duration
- Relationships defined but may need frontend interfaces

### Required Data Model Changes
1. **Group Entity Update**:
   - Change from `classId: string` to support many-to-many with classes
   - Add junction table or modify existing relationship structure
   - Update validation rules and indexes

### Frontend Architecture Analysis
Current frontend structure (from existing codebase):
- Nuxt.js 3.x with Vue.js 3.x and TypeScript
- Pinia for state management
- Component-based architecture
- Existing rules management at `/rules`

## Technology Decisions

### Frontend Approach
- **Component Strategy**: Create dedicated entity manager components for each entity type
- **State Management**: Individual Pinia stores per entity type + unified entities store
- **Form Handling**: Reusable EntityForm component with validation
- **Bulk Operations**: Excel import/export using SheetJS library
- **Search/Filter**: Client-side with debouncing for responsive UX

### Backend Approach (Minimal Changes)
- **Data Model**: Update Group entity to support many-to-many class relationships
- **API Updates**: Minimal - only update Group endpoints if needed
- **Validation**: Leverage existing validation patterns
- **Migration**: Database migration for Group-Class relationship change

### Performance Considerations
- **Entity Loading**: Lazy loading with pagination for large datasets
- **Bulk Operations**: Chunked processing for 500+ entities
- **Caching**: Client-side caching for reference data (subjects, teachers)
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with rollback on failure

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Model Updates
1. Update Group interface to support multiple class IDs
2. Create migration for Group-Class relationship change
3. Update existing API endpoints minimally

### Phase 2: Core Entity Components
1. Create base EntityForm component with validation
2. Implement individual entity managers (Group, Teacher, Subject, Course, Class)
3. Add Pinia stores for each entity type
4. Integrate with existing rules management page

### Phase 3: Relationship Management
1. Visual relationship editors
2. Constraint validation UI
3. Dependency visualization
4. Bulk relationship operations

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Excel import/export functionality
2. Bulk operations with progress tracking
3. Search and filtering across entities
4. Audit trail visualization

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Data Migration Complexity**: Changing Group-Class relationship might affect existing data
   - Mitigation: Careful migration script with rollback plan
2. **Performance with Large Datasets**: 500+ entities may impact UI responsiveness
   - Mitigation: Pagination, virtual scrolling, client-side caching

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **UX Complexity**: Managing relationships between 5 entity types can be confusing
   - Mitigation: Clear visual indicators, guided workflows, contextual help
2. **Validation Complexity**: Cross-entity validation rules may be complex
   - Mitigation: Clear error messages, real-time validation feedback

### Low Priority Risks
1. **Integration Issues**: New components might not fit existing design system
   - Mitigation: Follow established patterns, reuse existing components

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- All 5 entity types have full CRUD operations
- Bulk operations support 500+ entities
- Excel import/export works reliably
- Cross-entity validation prevents invalid states

### Performance Metrics
- Entity list loading: <2 seconds for 500 entities
- Bulk operations: <10 seconds for 100 entities
- Search response: <500ms for any query
- Form validation: <100ms response time

### UX Metrics
- User can complete entity management workflows without confusion
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Existing 001-schedule-builder data model
- Current Nuxt.js/Vue.js/TypeScript setup
- Existing Pinia stores and component patterns
- Backend API infrastructure

### New Dependencies (Minimal)
- SheetJS for Excel import/export
- Potentially vue-draggable for relationship management
- Chart.js or similar for relationship visualization (optional)

## Conclusion

This feature focuses primarily on frontend implementation with minimal backend changes. The main technical challenge is updating the Group-Class relationship from one-to-many to many-to-many, which requires careful data migration. The frontend implementation can leverage existing patterns and component structures while adding comprehensive entity management capabilities.

The approach prioritizes reusing existing infrastructure and patterns while providing a complete entity management solution that scales to school district requirements (500+ entities).
