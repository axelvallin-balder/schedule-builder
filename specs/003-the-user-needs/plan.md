# Implementation Plan: Entity and Relationship Management for Schedule Rules

**Branch**: `003-the-user-needs` | **Date**: October 2, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-the-user-needs/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Enable schedule administrators to manage the five core entities (Groups, Teachers, Courses, Subjects, Classes) and their relationships through the rules management page. The implementation focuses on frontend CRUD interfaces for entity management, with one backend update to support many-to-many Group-Class relationships. Leverages existing data model from 001-schedule-builder with minimal backend changes.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.2, Node.js 20.x + Nuxt.js 3.x, Vue.js 3.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: Pinia (state management), Tailwind CSS (styling), Vitest (testing)  
**Storage**: Existing PostgreSQL schema from 001-schedule-builder (minimal updates needed)  
**Testing**: Vitest for unit/integration tests, Vue Testing Library for components  
**Target Platform**: Web application (frontend focus)  
**Project Type**: web (frontend + minimal backend updates)  
**Performance Goals**: Support bulk operations for 500 entities (school district scale)  
**Constraints**: Reuse existing data model, minimize backend changes, focus on frontend implementation  
**Scale/Scope**: Medium scale (100-500 entities), school district level operations

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Code Quality First ✅
- Will follow TypeScript/Vue.js established patterns from existing codebase
- Component composition and reusable design patterns
- Consistent formatting with existing frontend code style
- ESLint/Prettier configuration already in place

### Comprehensive Testing ✅
- Unit tests for all entity management components using Vitest
- Integration tests for CRUD operations and relationship management
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows (create → relate → validate)
- Accessibility tests for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Performance tests for bulk operations (500 entity target)

### User Experience Consistency ✅
- Leverage existing design system and component patterns
- Consistent with current rules management page structure
- Responsive design for all entity management interfaces
- Accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Clear error messages and validation feedback
- Bulk operation UX with progress indicators

### Performance Excellence ✅
- Optimized for 500 entity bulk operations
- Efficient search/filtering for large datasets
- Lazy loading and pagination where appropriate
- Client-side caching for frequently accessed data

### Security by Design ✅
- Input validation for all entity fields
- Proper data sanitization before API calls
- Access control through existing authentication system
- Audit trail for entity changes (basic logging)

**Status**: All constitutional requirements addressed. No violations detected.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Database migration task for Group-Class many-to-many relationship [P]
- Backend API updates (minimal - Group endpoints only) [P] 
- Entity management component tasks (GroupManager, TeacherManager, etc.) [P]
- Pinia store creation tasks (groups, teachers, subjects, courses, classes) [P]
- Integration tasks for rules management page enhancement
- Testing tasks (unit, integration, e2e) following TDD approach
- Excel import/export functionality tasks
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → CRUD component task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: Database migration and minimal backend updates
- **Phase 2**: Entity type definitions and validation rules  
- **Phase 3**: Pinia stores for state management [P]
- **Phase 4**: Base EntityForm component (reusable)
- **Phase 5**: Individual entity manager components [P]
- **Phase 6**: Rules page integration and navigation
- **Phase 7**: Excel import/export functionality
- **Phase 8**: Testing (unit → integration → e2e)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on frontend implementation with minimal backend changes

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
