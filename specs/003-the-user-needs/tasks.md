# Tasks: Entity and Relationship Management for Schedule Rules

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-the-user-needs/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Extract: TypeScript 5.2, Nuxt.js 3.x, Vue.js 3.x, Pinia, Tailwind CSS
   → Structure: Web app (frontend focus + minimal backend)
2. Load design documents: ✓
   → data-model.md: 5 entities (Group, Teacher, Subject, Course, Class)
   → contracts/: Entity CRUD, bulk operations, relationship management
   → quickstart.md: Excel import/export workflows
3. Generate tasks by category: ✓
   → Setup: dependencies, types, migration
   → Tests: contract tests, component tests, integration tests
   → Core: stores, components, entity managers
   → Integration: rules page, Excel functionality
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, accessibility
4. Apply task rules: ✓
   → Different files = [P] for parallel
   → Related files = sequential
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T024) ✓
6. Focus on frontend with minimal backend changes ✓
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app structure**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/app/`
- Paths adjusted for existing schedule-builder structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Data Model
- [x] T001 Create database migration for Group-Class many-to-many relationship in `backend/src/migrations/003-entity-management.sql`
- [x] T002 [P] Install frontend dependencies (xlsx, file-saver) in `frontend/package.json`
- [x] T003 [P] Create entity TypeScript interfaces in `frontend/app/types/entities.ts`
- [x] T004 [P] Create validation rules definitions in `frontend/app/types/validation.ts`

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [x] T005 [P] Contract test GET /api/groups in `frontend/tests/services/group-api.test.ts`
- [x] T006 [P] Contract test POST /api/groups in `frontend/tests/services/group-api.test.ts`

#### Store Consolidation Strategy (T016-T020 Implementation Notes)

**Approach Taken**: Instead of rebuilding from scratch, a **compatibility-first consolidation strategy** was implemented to preserve existing working infrastructure while adding T016-T021 capabilities.

**Key Decisions**:
- **Preserved Legacy Types**: Continued using simple, proven type definitions from `frontend/app/stores/index.ts` instead of complex comprehensive types from `entities.ts`
- **Enhanced Existing Stores**: Enhanced `groups.ts` and `teachers.ts` that already existed with validation and bulk operations
- **Created Missing Stores**: Added `subjects.ts` and `courses.ts` following the same enhancement pattern
- **API Compatibility**: Maintained all existing API contracts and method signatures
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved entirely

**Enhanced Features Added**:
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations with validation
- ✅ Bulk operations (`bulkCreate`, `bulkDelete`) for batch processing
- ✅ Selection management (multi-select, toggle, clear)
- ✅ Search filtering across entity collections
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and user-friendly messaging
- ✅ Field-level validation with detailed error reports

**Documentation**: Full strategy documented in `docs/store-consolidation-strategy.md`

**Future Migration Path**: Foundation established for gradual migration to comprehensive entity types when business requirements justify the additional complexity.

### Frontend Components
- [ ] T022 Create reusable EntityForm component in `frontend/app/components/entities/EntityForm.vue`
- [ ] T023 [P] Create GroupManager component in `frontend/app/components/entities/GroupManager.vue`
- [ ] T024 [P] Create TeacherManager component in `frontend/app/components/entities/TeacherManager.vue`
- [ ] T025 [P] Create SubjectManager component in `frontend/app/components/entities/SubjectManager.vue`
- [ ] T026 [P] Create CourseManager component in `frontend/app/components/entities/CourseManager.vue`
- [ ] T027 [P] Create ClassManager component in `frontend/app/components/entities/ClassManager.vue`

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T028 Enhance rules management page with entity tabs in `frontend/app/pages/rules.vue`
- [ ] T029 Create Excel import service in `frontend/app/services/excelService.ts`
- [ ] T030 Create Excel export functionality in `frontend/app/services/exportService.ts`
- [ ] T031 Add bulk operations UI components in `frontend/app/components/entities/BulkOperations.vue`
- [ ] T032 Integrate relationship management UI in `frontend/app/components/entities/RelationshipManager.vue`

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T033 [P] Unit tests for entity stores in `frontend/tests/unit/stores/`
- [ ] T034 [P] Unit tests for entity components in `frontend/tests/unit/components/entities/`
- [ ] T035 [P] Unit tests for Excel services in `frontend/tests/unit/services/`
- [ ] T036 [P] Accessibility tests for entity management in `frontend/tests/accessibility/entity-management.test.ts`
- [ ] T037 Performance tests for bulk operations in `frontend/tests/performance/bulk-operations.test.ts`
- [ ] T038 [P] Update technical documentation in `docs/technical-documentation.md`
- [ ] T039 [P] Update user guide with entity management workflows in `docs/user-guide.md`
- [ ] T040 Run manual testing scenarios from quickstart.md

## Dependencies

- Entity types (T003-T004) before stores and components
- Tests (T005-T013) before implementation (T014-T032)
- EntityForm (T022) before individual entity managers (T023-T027)
- Stores (T016-T021) before components (T023-T027)
- Core components before integration (T028-T032)
- Implementation before polish (T033-T040)

Task: "Create GroupManager component in frontend/app/components/entities/GroupManager.vue"
Task: "Create TeacherManager component in frontend/app/components/entities/TeacherManager.vue"
Task: "Create SubjectManager component in frontend/app/components/entities/SubjectManager.vue"
Task: "Create CourseManager component in frontend/app/components/entities/CourseManager.vue"
Task: "Create ClassManager component in frontend/app/components/entities/ClassManager.vue"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks target different files and can be developed independently
- Focus on frontend implementation with minimal backend changes
- Verify all tests fail before starting implementation tasks
- Each entity manager follows the same component pattern for consistency
- Excel import/export supports business user workflows
- Commit after completing each task for clear progress tracking
- All components must follow existing accessibility and design standards

## Task Generation Rules Applied
- Each API contract → separate contract test task [P]
- Each entity (Group, Teacher, Subject, Course, Class) → dedicated store and component tasks [P]
- Different files → marked [P] for parallel execution
- Same file modifications → sequential tasks
- Tests written before implementation (TDD approach)
- Integration tasks after core implementation
- Polish tasks after all functionality complete
