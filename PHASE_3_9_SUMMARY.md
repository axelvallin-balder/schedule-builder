- **T060**: Security scanning pipeline for vulnerabilities
- **T061**: Dependency audit workflow with automated monitoring
- **T066**: Page load timing tests (< 2s requirement)
- **T067**: API response timing tests (< 200ms requirement)  
- **T068**: UI operation timing tests (< 100ms requirement)

### Sequential Tasks (T062-T065)
- **T062**: Screen reader compatibility implementation
- **T063**: Keyboard navigation system
- **T064**: Accessibility issues automated fixer
- **T065**: Security scanning recommendations implementation

## Key Implementations

### Security Features
1. **Comprehensive Security Scanning** (`backend/tests/security/security-scanning.test.ts`)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Static code analysis
   - Secrets detection
   - Docker security scanning
   - Automated reporting and alerting

2. **Dependency Management** (`backend/tests/security/dependency-audit.test.ts`)
   - Automated vulnerability detection
   - Update script generation
   - Risk assessment and reporting
   - Compliance monitoring

3. **Security Recommendations** (`frontend/src/security/recommendations.ts`)
   - XSS protection with CSP headers
   - CSRF protection with tokens
   - Security headers implementation
   - Strong authentication policies
   - Data protection and encryption
   - OWASP Top 10 compliance

### Accessibility Features
1. **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** (`frontend/tests/accessibility/wcag-compliance.test.ts`)
   - Comprehensive accessibility testing
   - Four WCAG principle coverage (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)
   - Mobile accessibility testing
   - Screen reader compatibility validation

2. **Screen Reader Support** (`frontend/src/accessibility/screen-reader.ts`)
   - ARIA attributes and labels
   - Live regions for dynamic content
   - Accessible component implementations
   - Screen reader announcements

3. **Keyboard Navigation** (`frontend/src/accessibility/keyboard-navigation.ts`)
   - Complete keyboard accessibility
   - Focus management system
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Tab order optimization

4. **Accessibility Issues Fixer** (`frontend/src/accessibility/issues-fixer.ts`)
   - Automated accessibility issue detection
   - WCAG violation fixing
   - Color contrast adjustments
   - Alt text generation

### Performance Testing
1. **Page Load Performance** (`frontend/tests/performance/page-load-timing.test.ts`)
   - Core Web Vitals measurement
   - Bundle size analysis
   - Image optimization testing
   - < 2 second requirement validation

2. **API Performance** (`backend/tests/performance/api-response-timing.test.ts`)
   - Response time testing
   - Load testing scenarios
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - < 200ms requirement validation

3. **UI Performance** (`frontend/tests/performance/ui-operation-timing.test.ts`)
   - Component rendering performance
   - Form interaction timing
   - Animation performance
   - < 100ms requirement validation

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards
- **OWASP Top 10**: Full compliance with security best practices
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Implementation of recommended controls
- **ISO 27001**: Security management system alignment

### Accessibility Standards
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Full compliance testing and implementation
- **Section 508**: Government accessibility requirements
- **EN 301 549**: European accessibility standard

### Performance Standards
- **Page Load**: < 2 seconds (Core Web Vitals)
- **API Response**: < 200ms average response time
- **UI Operations**: < 100ms for user interactions

## Testing Framework
- **Vitest**: Unit and integration testing
- **jest-axe**: Accessibility testing automation
