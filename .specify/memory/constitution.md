## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First
All code MUST follow strict quality standards:
- Use consistent formatting and style guides for each language
- Follow SOLID principles and clean code practices
- Maintain cyclomatic complexity below 10 per function
- Document all public APIs and complex algorithms
- Review code for readability and maintainability before merge

Rationale: High code quality reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and makes the codebase more scalable.

### II. Comprehensive Testing
Tests are non-negotiable and MUST be:
- Written before implementation (TDD approach)
- Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Include performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Test edge cases and error conditions explicitly

Rationale: Testing ensures reliability, prevents regressions, and documents expected behavior.

### III. User Experience Consistency
UX standards MUST be enforced:
- Follow established design system and patterns
- Implement responsive design for all interfaces
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Maintain consistent terminology across UI
- Provide clear error messages and user feedback
- Support keyboard navigation and screen readers

Rationale: Consistent UX improves user satisfaction and reduces cognitive load.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Performance standards MUST be met:
- Page load time < 2 seconds (95th percentile)
- API response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Client-side operations < 100ms
- Resource usage within defined limits
- Regular performance monitoring and optimization
- No UI blocking operations

Rationale: Performance directly impacts user experience and system usability.

### V. Documentation and Maintenance
All features MUST include:
- Clear technical documentation
- User guides and examples
- API documentation with examples
- Dependency documentation
- Update and maintenance procedures
- Version compatibility information

Rationale: Documentation ensures maintainability and knowledge transfer.

## Development Standards

### Code Review Process
- All changes require peer review
- Use pull request templates
- Automated checks must pass
- Review focuses on:
  * Code quality and style
  * Test coverage and quality
  * Performance implications
  * Documentation completeness
  * Security considerations

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Follow TDD workflow
3. Meet all quality gates
4. Peer review
5. Integration testing
6. Performance validation
7. Documentation review
8. Final approval

## Quality Assurance Process

### Automated Checks
- Linting and static analysis
- Unit test suite
- Integration test suite
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scanning
- Dependency audits

### Manual Verification
- Code review checklist
- UX consistency review
- Performance profiling
- Accessibility testing
- Documentation review

## Governance

The constitution serves as the foundational document for development standards and practices. Amendments require:

1. Formal proposal with rationale
2. Impact assessment on existing codebase
3. Team review and discussion
4. Consensus or designated approver acceptance
5. Documentation update
6. Developer notification
7. Implementation plan

Compliance Review:
- Regular audits of codebase against principles
- Quarterly review of standards effectiveness
- Annual constitution review and updates
- Continuous feedback collection

Version Control:
- MAJOR: Breaking changes to principles
- MINOR: New rules or significant clarifications
- PATCH: Minor clarifications or corrections
